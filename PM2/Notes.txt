- The programmer of this game probably had a jump table obsession, because these things were everywhere! It was annoying to disassemble.

- The only thing this programmer loved more than jump tables was unorganized RLE compressed files. They are so many of them!

- For whatever dumb reason, the arcade ports intentionally disable FastROM addressing, even going as far as storing #$00 to $420D. Why?

- The way this game handles switching between 8/16-bit A/X/Y made this game tricky to disassemble.
